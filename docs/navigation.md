# Navigation

Navigation should be clear, consistent, and predictable.

- Use a persistent main navigation bar.
- Highlight the current page or section.
- Provide breadcrumbs for multi-level navigation.
- Ensure all navigation is accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
- Avoid deep or complex menu structures.
