# Colour Usage

Use colour thoughtfully to enhance usability and brand identity.

- Maintain sufficient contrast between text and background.
- Do not rely on colour alone to convey information.
- Use a limited, consistent palette aligned with your brand.
- Provide a dark mode if possible.
- Test colour choices for colour blindness accessibility.
