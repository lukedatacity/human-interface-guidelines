# Typography

Typography should be clear, legible, and consistent.

- Use web-safe, readable fonts.
- Maintain a clear hierarchy with headings, subheadings, and body text.
- Ensure adequate line height and spacing.
- Avoid using too many font styles or sizes.
- Support user font scaling preferences.
